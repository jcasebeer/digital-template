<h2>Space Animal Control</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Save the depraved masses of homeless dogs from the cruelty of the universe.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
</br>
Feel the speed</br>
Feel the ruthless combat</br>
Become one with your spaceship </br>
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is basically a shoot-em-up.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

The player can change their ship's direction using the left and right keys. They can apply thrust with the up key and hit the breaks with the down key. The x button shoots a fast projectile from
the front of the player's ship in the direction the ship is facing. Once the player has applied thrust in a direction they will continue to move in that direction, slowly slowing down. A good strategy is to apply thrust in a direction, and then turn your ship around to shoot while moving away from enemy spacecraft. The player is awarded points by shooting down enemy ships and rescuing the doggy pilots. To rescue a dog, move your ship close to the dog and your tractor beam will pull the dog in. Enemy ships will slowly spawn into the world around the player at an ever increasing rate, they have simple ai which nontheless can create some interesting patterns. The whole point of the game is to score as many points as possible untill they eventually die, so players will need to master their own ship and understand the enemy ai to maximize their score.

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The flying and shooting mechanics. </br>
Enemy ai to a degree.</br>
To make a procedurally generated starfield using a pairing function.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
real-time Procedurally generated starfield </br>
Fast paced movement and combat </br>
challenging enemy ai </br>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in the vastness of space. Not much info is given about what's going on other than that you're a dog catcher and that dogs can now fly spaceships. While the game is fairly abstract, I think the premise that the dog catching profession continues to exist after dogs evolve the intelligence to build and pilot spacecraft is kind of funny. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If anything, the game's "story" lightens the game's mood.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is targeted at people who like dogs and shooting things.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
2 - 5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
</br>
Step 1: Apply thrust away from enemy ships </br>
Step 2: Turn ship around and shoot</br>
Step 3: Make a wide circle to scoop up doggies
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of the assets are from scratch with the exception of the music which can be found here: https://nikynine.bandcamp.com/track/ozuwara-theme
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
All of my gameplay was from scratch, however I did borrow the equation for parallax for my starfield from this phaser example: http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=demoscene&f=starfield.js&t=starfield
